## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Aja Washington (she/her)

I am a 28-year-old software engineer and Nashville native who has dedicated most of my life to the performing arts, including dancing, singing, and acting. Since the age of 15, I have been an instructor in the performing arts, choreographing, directing, and shaping curricula for future batches of young performers.

My transition to tech was motivated by a desire for a career that offers stability, consistent growth, and creativity. As a boot camp student, I became involved in the Nashville technical community around 2019, completing the Nashville Software School's (NSS) 6-month Full Stack Web Development course, focusing on Javascript/React, and C#/.Net programming languages and frameworks. 

After graduating, transitioning into tech instruction felt like a natural step with my years of experience in education. I was granted an opportunity to be a Junior Instructor at NSS in 2020 and was recently promoted to Senior Instructor in 2022 for the Evening Part Time Web Development Course. I have committed my time to expanding opportunities for marginalized communities and I highly value diversity, accessibility, and inclusivity in both the arts and tech.

I began my professional career at Eventbrite on their Frontend Infrastructure and Design Operations teams. I am a results-driven software engineer with expertise in optimizing web architecture, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and excelling in Lambda, API Gateway, CI/CD, and UI development. I am seeking a challenging role to contribute to a dynamic team by implementing innovative solutions, improving system scalability, driving development efficiencies, and leading teams to deliver high-quality products. My goal is to continuously enhance the organization's overall technical excellence.
